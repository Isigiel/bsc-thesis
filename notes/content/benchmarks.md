# Benchmarks
## Core idea
 - Find out if wasm is viable to dynamically runt things on IoT devices
 - See what impact the interpreter overhead has by running similar code on an ESP32 compiled native or to webAssembly

## Things to Benchmark
 - write speed 
 - memory speed
 - networking
 - compute speed
   - Look at https://www.eembc.org/coremark/ (embedded cpu benchmark)
 - latency
 - talk to peripharals
