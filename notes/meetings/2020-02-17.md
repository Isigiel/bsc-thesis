  - Figure out the number of recurvice calls
- Call native function multiple times
- Find random number alogrithm with seed
- Memory performance
  - Reading with sum
- Switch statement could run 1000 times as well
- Write about the optimization fight
- Look at different optimization levels
- Try to find limitations of the results
- Look at the wasm code (wat)
  - try to figure out what exactly the interpreter does
  - check out wasm structured control flow
- Check the simplest possible function
- Selected the fastest thing that compiles on microcontroller
- WRITING (about one week each)
- Background
  - Explain WASM common bytecode format
  - Modules and other structure
    - Rely on the specification
  - Interpreters and what they do
    - Explain basic structure
    - Crafting interpreters online-book
    - Whole bunch of available books on interpreters

  - Hardware section
    - ESP32 docs
    - FreeRTOS explananition
      - Rely on docs
- Methodology
  - Issues with optimization
  - Issues with memory

  - Setting up the intrpreter
  - Maybe find research papers on performance measurements
- Evaluation (Benchmarking) (Measurement & Evaluation)
- Grading
  - Overall quality: Methodology and test-cases, analysis
  - Litearature is about 2/23
    - Usually not huge
    - Use to establish the key ideas
    - Neglect when time runs out
