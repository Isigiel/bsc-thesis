# Meeting 13.01.2020

## Problems

- Not sure how to recognize code that would work (Only C?)
- Hard to figure out what can be embedded and how

## Progress

- Got wasm3 to calculate fibonacci numbers

## Next steps

- Focus on the working runtime and move on
- Test write speed / memory speed / networking / compute speed / latency / talk to peripharals
- Figure out how to test certain features
- Reason for teests: Run on IoT devices to make them dynamically programmable
- Try to build the same c code for wasm and native compilation
- Example with button and led

## New structure

- Think about the survey of existing runtimes
  - Practical experience and types of problems
- Evaluation
  - Test design Goal -> Benchmarks
  - Run benchamrks and analyze results
- Experiments in chapter 5
