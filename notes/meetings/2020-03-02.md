# Meeting 2.3.2020

## Comments

- Why those tests
  - Why and what am I testing
  - Approach of comparing against native
  - Different aspects -> different tests
  - Think about the switch statement
  - Bring back shuffle
  - THink abaout makinf the switch harder for the compiler
  - Try to include WASM in all testcases
- Think about setup code snippets 
- Prio 1 is results
- Prio 2 explain high level test design (1-2 pages)
  - Comparing native and wasm
  - Looking at different askpects
    - Key functionalities of a MCU
- Benchmarking
  - Not just list numbers, but give explanation
  - Based on the different resource the test is using
  - What is the device actually doing
  - What would a typical application be doing
  - Build coherent structure that makes sense of the numbers
  - How bad are the results
  - How heavy duty must the usage be to make it unfeasible
    - Indication that computation isn't a good fit for WASM
  - For each test explain what it means
    - Start with recursive => call other functions (although development doesn't need recursion)
    - Function calls could also be native
    - Switch => for control flows, is often used and more genric than if statement
    - Memory alsways needs memory
    - Matric is computaional and memory
  - Tie it together and come up with an overal finding
    - In which case feasible
    - What is lost using it
    - Try to help with the decision wether to use WebAssembly (not evaulating positive side)
    - How much more could hyou run if not using WASM
    - Power impact?
