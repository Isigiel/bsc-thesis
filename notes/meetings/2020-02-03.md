# Meeting 03.02.2020
## Problems
 - WRoom Version of the ESP32 doesn't have PSRam _(needed for WASI)_
 - Understand https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3-arduino/blob/master/wasm_apps/cpp/arduino_api.h

## Progress
 - In conctact with wasm3 folks and optimistic that more advanced ESP32 benchmarks would work
 - wasm3 has a way to call native code from the runtime
    ```
    m3ApiRawFunction(m3_arduino_delay)
        {
            m3ApiGetArg     (uint32_t, ms)

            // You can also trace API calls
            //Serial.print("api: delay "); Serial.println(ms);

            delay(ms);

            m3ApiSuccess();
        }
    ```
    ```
    IM3Module module = runtime->modules;
    const char* arduino = "arduino";
    m3_LinkRawFunction (module, arduino, "delay", "v(i)",   &m3_arduino_delay);
    ```

## Plans
 - Can we get a WRover ESP32?
 - Continue understanding how to call native code
 - Begin building some ESP32 benchmarks
   - Consider building non-native and native benchmarks
 - Provide needed bindings for benchmarks to run as WASM module
   - Consider demoing bindings for assemblyScript or other langugaes (Rust, TinyGo)

## Next week
 - Get a simple non-native testcase running in wasm and native
 - Start out with fibonacci demo
 - Use `esp_timer_get_time()`
