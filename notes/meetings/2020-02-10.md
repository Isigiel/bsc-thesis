## Next week
 - Measure webAssembly overhead
 - Get values from running the same function all the time (1000x) (100*10x)
 - Run all webAssembly measurements first, native second
 - Take timestamps outside the loop
 - Dont't print in the measuremnt loop
 - Find out variance and standard variation
 - Matrix multiply
 - Memory operations (linear and random writes and reads in array)
 - Coremark branch prediction
 - Call out to a function that just stores the timestamp in a global variable (with return)
 - Large switch statements with random data (protocols and interpreters, serialization) 10-20 cases
 - Branch prediction could be interesting
