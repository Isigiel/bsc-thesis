	abstract = {{WebAssembly}, or Wasm for short, is a new, low-level language that allows for near-native execution performance and is supported by all major browsers as of today. In comparison to {JavaScript} it offers faster transmission, parsing, and execution times. Up until now it has, however, been largely unclear what {WebAssembly} is used for in the wild. In this paper, we thus conduct the first large-scale study on the Web. For this, we examine the prevalence of {WebAssembly} in the Alexa Top 1 million websites and find that as many as 1 out of 600 sites execute Wasm code. Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses, including an evaluation of code characteristics and the assessment of a Wasm module's field of application. Based on this, we find that over 50 \% of all sites using {WebAssembly} apply it for malicious deeds, such as mining and obfuscation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09056},
	shorttitle = {Not So Fast},
	abstract = {All major web browsers now support {WebAssembly}, a low-level bytecode intended to serve as a compilation target for code written in languages like C and C++. A key goal of {WebAssembly} is performance parity with native code; previous work reports near parity, with many applications compiled to {WebAssembly} running on average 10\% slower than native code. However, this evaluation was limited to a suite of scientific kernels, each consisting of roughly 100 lines of code. Running more substantial applications was not possible because compiling code to {WebAssembly} is only part of the puzzle: standard Unix {APIs} are not available in the web browser environment. To address this challenge, we build Browsix-Wasm, a significant extension to Browsix that, for the first time, makes it possible to run unmodified {WebAssembly}-compiled Unix applications directly inside the browser. We then use Browsix-Wasm to conduct the first large-scale evaluation of the performance of {WebAssembly} vs. native. Across the {SPEC} {CPU} suite of benchmarks, we find a substantial performance gap: applications compiled to {WebAssembly} run slower by an average of 45\% (Firefox) to 55\% (Chrome), with peak slowdowns of 2.08x (Firefox) and 2.5x (Chrome). We identify the causes of this performance degradation, some of which are due to missing optimizations and code generation issues, while others are inherent to the {WebAssembly} platform.},
